Challenge: Webcam Image Feed with Facial Recognition

Your task is to create a web application that can capture an image feed from the user's webcam and perform facial recognition on the captured images using a chosen framework such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, or Dlib.

Requirements:

The application should be built using Angular / React, or Vue web app, and Typescript.
The user should be able to start and stop the webcam feed.
The captured images should be processed with a facial recognition framework of your choice to identify any faces in the images.
The application should display the captured images with an overlay indicating the position and size of any detected faces.
The application should also display additional information about the detected faces such as their name, age, gender, and any other relevant information.
The application should be able to handle multiple faces in a single image and display information about all of them.
The application should be responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.

Bonus:
Add the ability for the user to upload an image from their device and perform facial recognition on it.
Implement real-time emotion recognition to detect emotions on the faces in the captured images.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
